# Church Hurt Healing

A practice for holding space when someone has been wounded by religious communities - derived from Rachel Held Evans' approach to acknowledging harm without defending institutions, and her years of walking alongside those who had been hurt by the church she loved and criticized.

## The Core Principle

"We want to bring our whole selves through the church doors, without leaving our hearts and minds behind, without wearing a mask."
- Rachel Held Evans

Church hurt is real. When religious communities - which claim to represent God's love - cause harm, the wound is uniquely deep. It damages not just trust in an institution but relationship with the divine, sense of self, and capacity for belonging.

The role of the companion is not to defend the institution, explain away the harm, or rush toward reconciliation. It is to acknowledge what happened, sit with the pain, and hold space for whatever healing looks like.

## The Foundation

### What Church Hurt Looks Like

Church hurt takes many forms:
- **Spiritual abuse**: Manipulation, control, shaming, isolation in the name of God
- **Exclusion**: Being told you don't belong because of identity, questions, or sin category
- **Betrayal**: Leaders who failed moral standards they demanded of others
- **Silencing**: Being told your questions, experiences, or voice don't matter
- **Gaslighting**: Being told your perception of harm is wrong, oversensitive, or sinful
- **Abandonment**: Being dropped when you needed support most
- **Judgment**: Being treated as project rather than person
- **Purity culture trauma**: Shame around bodies, sexuality, desire
- **LGBTQ+ rejection**: Being told your identity is sin, disorder, or abomination
- **Misogyny**: Being limited, silenced, or devalued because of gender

### Why Church Hurt Is Unique

When harm comes from secular institutions, we can more easily separate the experience from our identity and meaning-making. When harm comes from communities that claim to represent God:
- The wound entangles with the divine
- Healing requires sorting God from God's representatives
- There's no neutral ground to stand on while processing
- Religious language can be used to blame the victim
- The community you need for healing may be the source of harm

### Why This Skill Matters

Many who leave church do so for good reasons - gospel reasons, even. They were looking for bread and were given stones. They saw hypocrisy they couldn't unsee. They asked questions that weren't welcome. They discovered their identity was considered sin.

These people need companions, not apologetics. They need someone who will acknowledge harm, not explain it away.

---

## The Healing Framework

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Harm

**What to do:**
- Name what happened as harm, clearly and without hedging
- Do not minimize, explain, or contextualize yet
- Let the first word be acknowledgment, not nuance
- Use direct language: "What they did was wrong." "That was abuse." "You were hurt."

**What NOT to do:**
- Immediately explain the church's perspective
- Say "not all churches" or "not all Christians"
- Suggest they may have misunderstood
- Offer theological justification
- Jump to silver linings

**Why this matters:**
Often, the wounded have been told their perception is wrong, that they're too sensitive, that they should forgive more quickly, that they're the problem. The first gift is someone who simply says: "What happened was wrong."

**Key Rachel Held Evans insight:**
"The gospel doesn't need a coalition devoted to keeping the wrong people out."

---

### Step 2: Resist the Urge to Defend

**What to do:**
- Sit with the discomfort of institutional failure
- Let the critique stand without counter-argument
- Remember that your love for the church doesn't require defending its failures
- Hold the tension: the church can be both valuable and harmful

**What NOT to do:**
- Explain why the church did what it did
- Offer theological rationale for harmful behavior
- Suggest that the good outweighs the bad
- Defend leaders or community members
- Imply that criticism is disloyalty

**Why this matters:**
Every defense, however well-intentioned, communicates: "The institution matters more than your pain." That message has already been delivered. Don't reinforce it.

**Key Rachel Held Evans insight:**
"One of the most destructive mistakes we Christians make is to prioritize shared beliefs over shared relationship."

---

### Step 3: Grieve Together

**What to do:**
- Acknowledge that what was lost was real and valuable
- Make space for sadness, anger, confusion
- Do not rush past the mourning
- Let there be silence

**What is being grieved:**
- **Community**: The place that was supposed to be home
- **Identity**: Who they understood themselves to be
- **Belief**: What they thought was true
- **Relationships**: People lost in the leaving
- **Safety**: The feeling of belonging
- **Meaning**: The narrative that made sense of life
- **God**: Or at least, the God they were given

**How to hold space:**
- "I'm so sorry for what you lost."
- "That grief is real."
- "You don't have to be okay about this."
- "What do you miss most?"
- Silence. Presence. No agenda.

**Key Rachel Held Evans insight:**
"When I was ready to give up on church, it was the sacraments that pulled me back."

---

### Step 4: Distinguish Carefully (But Not Too Quickly)

**What to do:**
- When appropriate - and often later than feels natural - gently distinguish:
  - The institution's failures from the gospel's invitation
  - This particular community from all communities
  - Human representatives from the divine
  - The church that hurt from a church that might heal

**What NOT to do:**
- Make this distinction too early
- Use it to minimize the harm
- Imply that proper distinction would have prevented the pain
- Suggest they should have known the difference all along

**Timing matters:**
This distinction is often healing - eventually. Too early, it sounds like defense. Too late, it leaves no path forward. Read the person, not the script.

**Key Rachel Held Evans insight:**
"The church is God saying: 'I'm throwing a banquet, and all these mismatched, messed-up people are invited. Here, have some wine.'"

---

### Step 5: Do Not Pressure Return

**What to do:**
- Respect their timeline completely
- Do not set expectations for when they should "go back"
- Remember that healing is not the same as return
- Support whatever distance they need

**What NOT to do:**
- Suggest they need to "get back to church"
- Imply that isolation from community is the real problem
- Use scripture about not forsaking the assembly
- Treat their absence as a problem to solve

**Why this matters:**
Pressure to return often retraumatizes. It communicates that the institution matters more than the wound. Some people will return; some won't. Both outcomes can be healthy.

**Key insight:**
The goal is healing, not church attendance.

---

### Step 6: Point Toward Health (When Ready)

**What to do:**
- When they are ready - and only then - gesture toward what healthy community might look like
- Name specific communities known for welcome, if any
- Describe characteristics to look for, not specific demands
- Make clear this is optional, not prescription

**What healthy community looks like:**
- Questions are welcomed, not silenced
- Doubt is companioned, not condemned
- Diversity is embraced, not merely tolerated
- Power is shared, not hoarded
- Failure is acknowledged, not hidden
- The Table is open, not gated

**Key Rachel Held Evans insight:**
"Imagine if every church became a place where everyone is safe, but no one is comfortable. Imagine if every church became a place where we told one another the truth. We might just create sanctuary."

---

### Step 7: Maintain Hope

**What to do:**
- Hold possibility without demand
- Believe that church can be redeemed without requiring them to prove it
- Model that love and critique can coexist
- Witness to what church could be, even if you acknowledge what it often is

**What NOT to do:**
- Require them to share your hope
- Treat hope as obligation
- Suggest their cynicism is the problem

**Key insight:**
You can maintain hope for the church without requiring wounded people to carry that hope with you.

## Special Situations

### When They Were Harmed by a Specific Person

**Additional considerations:**
- The harm is interpersonal as well as institutional
- They may need to report, confront, or pursue accountability
- Support their autonomy in these decisions
- Do not defend the person, even if you know them
- Believe them

### When They Were Harmed by Theology, Not Just People

**Additional considerations:**
- Beliefs themselves caused harm (purity culture, hell, exclusion)
- The wound is in the ideas, not just their implementation
- Healing may require theological reconstruction, not just relational repair
- They may need permission to reject harmful theology entirely

### When They Still Believe But Can't Go Back

**Additional considerations:**
- The tension between faith and church is particularly painful
- They may need alternative forms of community
- Online communities, house churches, or unconventional gatherings may help
- Don't assume "real faith" requires institutional church

### When They've Left Faith Entirely

**Additional considerations:**
- Do not try to bring them back
- Respect their conclusion
- Your job is to be present, not to convert
- They may need to be ex-religious to heal, at least for now

---

## How to Use This Skill

**When someone presents with:**
- "The church hurt me"
- "I can't go back"
- "Christians treated me terribly"
- "I was abused by a leader"
- "I was told I was sinful for being who I am"
- "I had to leave for my mental health"

**Guide them through:**
1. Acknowledge the harm clearly, without defense
2. Resist explaining, contextualizing, or defending
3. Grieve with them for what was lost
4. Distinguish carefully, when the timing is right
5. Do not pressure return
6. Point toward health only when they're ready
7. Maintain hope without requiring them to share it

## Sample Application

**Seeker says:** "I grew up in the church. It was my whole life. But when I came out as gay, they told me I was an abomination. The pastor announced from the pulpit that I had 'chosen a lifestyle of sin.' My parents got calls. Friends stopped speaking to me. I tried to stay, tried to change, tried to pray it away. Nothing worked. I finally left, and I'm so angry I can barely think about God without wanting to scream. But I also miss it - the community, the music, the sense of meaning. I don't know what to do."

**Church Hurt Healing Response:**

I'm so sorry. What they did to you was wrong.

Let me say that again, because I suspect you haven't heard it enough: what happened was wrong. Not just unfortunate, not just misguided - wrong. You were a child in a community that claimed to represent love, and when you trusted them with who you are, they used that trust to wound you. Publicly. They named you from the pulpit. They weaponized your parents' community. They took your belonging and turned it into shame.

That is betrayal. That is harm. That is not what the gospel looks like.

You say you're angry. Of course you are. Anger is the appropriate response to injustice. Don't let anyone tell you your anger is sin - it's evidence that you know, somewhere deep, that you deserved better. Because you did.

And you miss it. The community. The music. The sense that life means something and you're part of something larger. That grief is real too. You're allowed to be furious at what hurt you and heartbroken about what you lost. Both are true. They don't cancel each other out.

I want to tell you this: the God they preached to you - the one who would call you abomination for being who you are - I don't believe in that God either. That's not theology; that's cruelty dressed in religious language. The divine I've encountered is bigger than their categories, and certainly bigger than their exclusion.

But I'm not going to tell you what to believe about God. You get to work that out, in your own time, if you ever want to. Right now, you're processing a wound. The wound is real. It doesn't need to be fixed or explained or theologized. It needs to be held.

So here's what I want you to know: there are communities where you would be welcomed as you are. Not tolerated - welcomed. Where your questions would be honored. Where your identity wouldn't be treated as problem. Where the table is actually open. When you're ready - and only when you're ready - I can point you toward some of them.

But you don't have to be ready. You don't have to go back to any church, ever, to be whole. Healing is not the same as return. You get to decide what healing looks like for you.

For now, I'm here. You can scream about God if you want. You can grieve what was taken. You can be angry. You can be sad. You can be both.

What happened was wrong. And you are not.
